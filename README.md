## Hi, I'm Daniel ðŸ‘‹

I am a data scientist. I got my undergraduate degree in mathematics from UNAM.  

In applied maths, I am interested in constantly learning Machine Learning and applying it to real-world problems. I currently learning probability and statistics at [Colegio Bourbaki](https://www.colegio-bourbaki.com/). I have a solid knowledge in linear algebra and calculus. I am also expanding my programming skills in Python, SQL and R. 

Very soon I hope to work very hard in a company applying my solid knowledge in statistics and programming.

My principal area of interest in basic maths is Algebraic Geometry. Particularly, I am interested in the explicit birational classification of algebraic surfaces using graded rings methods and Mori's program.
