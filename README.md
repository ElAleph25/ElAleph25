# Hi, I'm Daniel ðŸ‘‹

## Applied maths 

I am a mathematician interest in using Machine Learning algorithms for Data Science. 

I currently learning probability and statistics at [Colegio Bourbaki](https://www.colegio-bourbaki.com/). I am also expanding my programming skills in Python, SQL and R. 

## Basic maths 

My principal area of interest in basic maths is Algebraic Geometry and Commutative Algebra. Particularly, I am interested in the explicit birational classification of algebraic surfaces using graded rings methods and Mori's program.
