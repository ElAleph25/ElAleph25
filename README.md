# Hi, I'm Daniel 

## About me 

I am a mathematician. I live in Mexico City. I love film photography and cinema. The next photo is from the movie "Fallen Angels", directed by Wong Kar Wai.

## Basic maths 

My principal area of interest in basic maths is Algebraic Geometry and Commutative Algebra. Particularly, I am interested in the explicit birational classification of algebraic surfaces using graded rings methods and Mori's program.

## Applied maths 

I interest in using Machine Learning algorithms for Data Science. 

I currently learning probability and statistics at [Colegio Bourbaki](https://www.colegio-bourbaki.com/). I am also expanding my programming skills in Python, SQL and R. 


## Projects
- I will upload examples of application of Machine Learning algorithms for Data Science using real data sets.
- I will solve interesting exercises on algebraic geometry and commutative algebra. To begin, I leave you my bachelor's thesis in algebraic geometry written in Spanish.
